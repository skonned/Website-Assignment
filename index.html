            <h1>Milford Sound</h1>
            <p>Some describe this breathtaking fjord as the eighth wonder of the world! Travellers and locals alike travel to Fiordland National Park to hop on a boat trip and admire the dramatic cliff faces, carved by ancient glaciers. You’ll glide through the water, passing cascading waterfalls and spot the adorable residents - fur seals, dolphins and penguins. Despite its name, Milford Sound is actually a fiord, not a sound. It is also the only fiord in New Zealand that is accessible by road. However, its remote location, bounded by steep cliffs and dense rainforest, means its special features remain unspoilt.</p>

            <h1>Wai-O-Tapu</h1>
            <p>Wai-O-Tapu is an active geothermal area at the southern end of the Okataina Volcanic Centre, just north of the Reporoa caldera, in New Zealand's Taupo Volcanic Zone. It is 27 kilometres south of Rotorua. Due to dramatic geothermal conditions beneath the earth, the area has many hot springs noted for their colourful appearance, in addition to the Lady Knox Geyser, Champagne Pool, Artist's Palette, Primrose Terrace and boiling mud pools. These can mostly be viewed through access by foot, and in addition to a paid and curated experience, naturally forming hot springs appear around the area. The geothermal area covers 18 square kilometres. Prior to European occupation the area was the homeland of the Ngāti Whaoa tribe who descended from those on the canoe.</p>
