            <h1>Milford Sound</h1>
            <p>Some describe this breathtaking fjord as the eighth wonder of the world! Travellers and locals alike travel to Fiordland National Park to hop on a boat trip and admire the dramatic cliff faces, carved by ancient glaciers. You’ll glide through the water, passing cascading waterfalls and spot the adorable residents - fur seals, dolphins and penguins. Despite its name, Milford Sound is actually a fiord, not a sound. It is also the only fiord in New Zealand that is accessible by road. However, its remote location, bounded by steep cliffs and dense rainforest, means its special features remain unspoilt.</p>
